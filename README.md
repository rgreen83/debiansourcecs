apt sources.list for various releases
this is mostly for my own use and tracking, but its available for anyone to use
you don't need this, you can just use the official documentation https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList
also you will find there this info to keep in mind because many people will suggest otherwise, "Avoid using stable in your sources.list as that results in nasty surprises and broken systems when the next release is made; upgrading to a new release should be a deliberate, careful action and editing a file once every two years is not a burden."
